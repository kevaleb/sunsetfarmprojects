Hello everyone,
 
Merry Wives if reopening soon. We need help cleaning it and wanted to offer it out to UO members first. It pays $15 per hour to 18+ and $5 per hour 12+ (with supervision). We are trying to open for Halloween, so I need this project done by the 29th. 

You can contact Amanda Knudson at 435-212-3048 if you would like to help. We need about 4 men to help.
                
Also we are hiring as well. If you are interested in employment contact Samuel Timpson at 435-212-3048 and email your resume to samueltimpson@primeres.com.
