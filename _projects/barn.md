The “new barn,” as it is commonly referred to, is actually the primary centerpiece of the Sunset Farms projects. It is located in the southwest quarter of Centennial Park. The initial structure of the barn commenced many years ago when a few families conceptualized the “UO” farming enterprises. This barn is now a primary focus for our community of industrious members to bring to completion and use. This barn will provide facilities and housing for many things including the dairy, a large multi-use kitchen, facilities for production of dairy products, a country store, refrigeration and freezer storage, massive lower level dry and cold storage, and an attic that can hold volumes of key supplies. The barn will be surrounded by beautiful pasture areas, cattle corrals and gardens and is directly accessible via paved roads.
