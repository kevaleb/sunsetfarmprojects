Our chicken enterprise has been highly successful in supplying our members with an abundance of wholesome chicken throughout the year. Chicken harvests have been a central activity for our members to associate together: men, women and children. This healthy enterprise currently offers whole chickens in February, May, June, October and November. Plans are in the works to provide whole and cut chickens throughout the year (all months) along with organic eggs.
